<h3>Things you need to bring in:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Gift (of course, duh!)</li>
    <li>An empty stomach (for the cake)</li>
    <li>And... one more gift!! ('Coz why not!?)</li>
</ul>
<h3>If you have somehow forgotten where I live, no excuses would work, here's the google link to my address! Do come, I will be waiting for you (but more for your gifts!)</h3>
